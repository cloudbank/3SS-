An Android dhash algorithm that uses 3SS to do NN, greyscale, and fingerprint in one pass, and match images for similarity using
a modified Hamming distance algorithm.
Traditionally the epsilon would be found in practice by calculating XOR of two fingerprints and setting a bound on how many set bits 
may vary.  Instead, I keep track of each fingerprint's set bit count using MIT's fast MEMHACK bitwise algorithm in a garbage free
map structure.  This changes an O(n) db search for each image into an O((epsilon * 2)+1) number of constant time checks in the map.
Since epsilon is usually quite small (~2), it is constant amount of work for each image.
This is still in the experimental phase and under development.

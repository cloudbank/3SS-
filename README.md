An Android dhash algorithm that uses 3SS to do NN, greyscale, and fingerprint in one pass, and match images for similarity using
a modified Hamming distance algorithm.
Traditionally the epsilon would be found in practice by calculating XOR of two fingerprints and setting a bound on how many set bits 
may vary.  Instead, I keep track of each fingerprint's set bit count using MIT's fast MEMHACK bitwise algorithm in a garbage free
map structure.  This changes an O(n) db search for each image into an O((epsilon * 2)+1) number of constant time checks in the map.
Since epsilon is usually quite small (~2), it is constant amount of work for each image.
This is still in the experimental phase and under development.
Available in C++ and Kotlin.


3SS describes the 3 steps of the dhash algorithm in one pass for image detection, optimized for use with Android(row hash only, DirectBuffer to JNI or Kotlin implementation). It is using NN for scaling with exact detection.  Future releases may use a better algorithm for reduction and calculate the hamming distance for similarity comparison. It is currently working on complex images with box  interpolation and these shortcuts.

## Best times for hashing, so far:

* JNI C++ nativeDHash: .4secs

* Kotlin dHash:

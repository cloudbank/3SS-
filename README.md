An Android image fingerprint algorithm to match images for similarity or distortion.  Similarity could  be defined by something like color or contrast changes.  I am experimenting to see how I can corelate two hashes as such using FMIQ, Haar transform, Radon fingerprinting, or Deep Autoencoders within Android or the CSS algo with better downsize for disortions. I also may try to incorporate checks for rotation by obtaining additional fingerprints.

This is still in the experimental phase and under development, and hopefully the data will be turn out to be compatible on average.






## Best times for hashing, so far:

* JNI C++ nativeDHash: 

* Kotlin dHash:
